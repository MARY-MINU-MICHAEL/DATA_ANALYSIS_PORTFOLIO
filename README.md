# Mary Minu Michael - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About
Hi I'm Mary Minu Michael. I'm data analyst who is taking baby steps towards the vast field of data analysis. I just completed my post graduation in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics, and I did an under graduation in Mathematics. I've a Â background in Mathematics and statistics now I want to build a strong background in Data Analytics field by working on real world datasets.

I've always been fascinated in solving puzzles and playing with numbers. So I hope I'll be able to find valuable insights from datasets like solving an interesting puzzle.

In this repository I would like to showcase various projects I did that are related to Data Analytics / Data Science and hence can track my progress in these fields.

## Study Projects
In this section I'll provide links to the projects I did as a part of a Data analysis course I did on an online study platform called great learning.
