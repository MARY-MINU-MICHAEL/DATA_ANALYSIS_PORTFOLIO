## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi, I'm Mary Minu MIchael! ðŸ‘‹I'm an aspiring data analyst who is taking baby steps towards the vast field of data analytics.I did a post graduation in Applied Statistics and data analytics and an undergraduation in Mathematics. I have a very good background in Mathematics and Statistics and now I want to build a strong background in data analytics field.

I was always fascinated about solving puzzles and playing with numbers. So I hope I'll be able to find interesting patterns and hence create valuable insights from a dataset just like solving a puzzle.

In this repository I would like to showcase my skills and upload projects I did related to Data Analysis / Data Science field and hence to track my progress in these fields.

## Study projects
**Here you can see some simple and complex projects I did as part of some online courses and internships.**
  ### 1. Uber Data Analysis
  **Code**: [Uber Data Analysis](https://github.com/MARY-MINU-MICHAEL/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Uber_Data_Analysis.ipynb)

**Programming Language**: Python

  **Description**: Two datasets containing the details about cab rides during the time December 2018 and details about weather at that time are used for this project.Several visualizations showing the relationship between weather and number of cab rides are shown in this project. A model for price prediction of cabs using linear regression is also made in this project.

  **Skills**: Data cleaning,Data analysis,Data visualization,Model building,Linear regression.
 
### 2. Python Libraries
 **Code**:[Matplotlib-and-Seaborn](https://github.com/MARY-MINU-MICHAEL/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Uber_Data_Analysis.ipynb)
  
### 3. TODO LIST APP
  **Code**: [TODO LIST APP](https://github.com/MARY-MINU-MICHAEL/TODO-LIST-APP)
  
  **Description**: A simple TODO LIST App is made using Flask framework
  
  **Languages**:Python,HTML
  
  
### 4. Iris Flower Classification

**Code**:[Iris flower classification](https://github.com/MARY-MINU-MICHAEL/LGMVIP-TASK1/blob/main/LGMVIP_IRIS_DATASET_TASK_1.ipynb)

**Programming Language**:Python

**Description**: Exploratory data analysis and data visualizations are done on iris flower dataset using pyhton.K Means clustering is used to find out the optimum number of cluster in the iris dataset.

**Skills**:Data analysis,Exploratory data analysis, Data visualization,Model building,K Means clustering

### 5. IMAGE TO PENCIL SKETCH USING PYTHON

**Code**:[IMAGE TO PENCIL SKETCH USING PYTHON](https://github.com/MARY-MINU-MICHAEL/LGMVIP-TASK-2/blob/main/LGMVIP%20(1).ipynb)

**Programming Language**:Python

**Description**: Using the python imaging library image of a flower is converted to various forms like grayscale image, blurred image etc.

**Skills**:Python imaging library(PIL),Python
