#Mary Minu Michael - Data Analysis Portfolio

##About
Hi I'm Mary Minu Michael. I'm an aspiring data analyst who is taking baby steps towards the vast field of data analysis. I just completed my post graduation in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics, and I did an under graduation in Mathematics. I've a Â background in Mathematics and statistics now I want to build a strong background in Data Analytics field by working on real world datasets.

I've always been fascinated in solving puzzles and playing with numbers. So as an aspiring data analyst I hope I'll be able to find valuable insights from datasets like solving an interesting puzzle.

In this repository I would like to showcase various projects that are related to Data Analytics / Data Science and hence can track my progress in these fields.
